# Responsive_Portfolio
Mobile Responsive pages 

// Description //
Here, I created a basic web layout for a portfolio website and made it mobile responsive using the bootstrap grid system as well media queries. I also used css stylings and bootstrap components to inform the visual identity of the page.

I worked with my partner Elijah on a lot of this. I really appreciated having someone to bounce ideas off of for the design of this page.
